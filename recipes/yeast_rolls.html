    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup melted salted butter + 1tbsp reserved</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 packets active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup of water warmed to 115F</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, melted butter, sugar and yeast in a bowl. Mix until the yeast is broadly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Wait 10-15 minutes for the yeast to activate (the activated yeast will rise on top of the butter).</li>
        <li>Pour yeast mixture into a bowl and gradually incorporate the salt and flour.</li>
        <li>When the dough is workable (slightly tacky, but doesn't stick to your hands), knead for 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Portion into roughly 10 rolls on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes (you can preheat the oven to 400F at this time).</li>
        <li>Baste the tops of each roll with reserved butter. </li>
        <li>Cook for 8-10 minutes at 400F or until golden.</li>
    </ol>
